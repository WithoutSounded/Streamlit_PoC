# Streamlit_PoC

This project is an early Proof of Concept (PoC) for building a lightweight internal service platform using Streamlit. The goal is to explore whether such a platform can support non-technical departments within the company (such as Finance, Legal, Operations, etc.) with a user-friendly interface.
